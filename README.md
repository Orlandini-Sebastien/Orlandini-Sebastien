# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sébastien Orlandini

I'm a junior Full Stack Developer with a passion for creating dynamic and efficient web applications. I'm currently looking for an opportunity to start my career, whether it's through an apprenticeship or my first full-time job.

## 🚀 What I Do
I love use **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailWind** and **Framer Motion** ⚡️  
I specialize in front-end development with **React**, **Vite**, but I'm also skilled in back-end development using **Node.js**. I have experience working with databases like **MongoDB** and **PostgreSQL**, and I use **Prisma** as my ORM of choice.

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

I'm actively seeking an apprenticeship or a first full-time position as a **Back-End**, **Front-End**, or **Full Stack Developer**. I'm eager to bring my skills to a dynamic team where I can continue to grow and contribute to exciting projects.

Feel free to reach out if you have an opportunity or would like to collaborate!
